# Microwave-and-Radar-System-Coverage-Resolution-Timing-and-Sampling
This repository contains calculations on the basic characteristics of antennas in the microwave and radar remote sensing. This calculations were the part of 'Microwave and Radar Remote Sensing' course offered by TU Berlin. Exercises were designed by Marc Rodriguez-Cassola and Andreas Reigber and exercise classes ran by Francescopaolo Sica
